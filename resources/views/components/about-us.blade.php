                    they’ll make extraordinary games that achieve the unexpected. Respawn Entertainment is the Academy Award-winning

                    Fallen Order, and Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond. As a collective of creative developers, we have launched

                                Our passion for gameplay inspired the use of the braille letter “R” as our logo. It signifies our dedication
                                to making games that feel good to play. We believe that every facet of the gameplay experience should feel
                                “just right,” and we discover what's fun by constantly playing our games and listening to our community.
                                We listen. We adapt. We find the fun.
